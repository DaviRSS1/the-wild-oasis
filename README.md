# 🏨 The Wild Oasis

The Wild Oasis is a full-stack React application built for **study purposes**, developed while following an advanced React course and expanded with additional custom features.

The application simulates a real hotel management dashboard, allowing staff members to manage cabins, bookings, and guests in a professional admin interface.

Beyond the course implementation, this project was extended with additional features such as **booking creation** and full **CRUD operations for guests**, including a dedicated Guests page and table.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

This application was developed for **advanced React practice**, focusing on building a real-world, production-style admin dashboard.

The goal was to simulate real SaaS-level architecture while strengthening knowledge in:

- State management patterns
- Server state vs UI state
- Data synchronization
- Component reusability
- Backend integration
- Performance optimization
- Scalable frontend architecture

Additional features like full Guests CRUD and booking creation were implemented independently to go beyond the course scope and solidify backend + frontend integration skills.
